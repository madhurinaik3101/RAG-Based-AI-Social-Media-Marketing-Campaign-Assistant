        "description": "NIKE TURNS BRAZIL'S WOMEN TEAM INTO A NIGHTMARE FOR OPPONENTS IN NEW “SCARY GOOD” FILM\n\n“The Legend of the Canarinha” features Kerolin, Angelina, and Gio and tells the story of why Brazil’s women’s team strikes fear across South American football.\nCelebrating Brazil’s qualification for the grand final of the biggest women’s national team competition in South America, held in Ecuador, Nike has released the animation “The Legend of the Canarinha” to highlight the talent of the women’s national team players as they write another chapter in their winning legacy. But unlike traditional fairy tales, Nike flips the script—turning the legacy and bright future of the Canarinha into a horror story.\n“This film is an invitation for everyone to feel the power and legacy of our national team, recognizing the talent that inspires a new generation of girls who love football. We want to show that Brazilian athletes don’t just make history—they’re shaping the future of the sport with every dribble, goal, and victory,” says Gustavo Viana, Marketing Director at Fisia, Nike’s official distributor in Brazil.\nConceived by Wieden+Kennedy São Paulo and produced by Dirty Work, the animation draws inspiration from stop-motion techniques and the aesthetics of the 1990s, creating a bold visual to tell the team’s story. The film highlights the key traits of Kerolin, Angelina, and Gio—players who make their rivals tremble—showing that what lies ahead commands even more respect than what’s already been achieved.\nThe power of the story comes to life with the narration:\n“Long ago, the continent saw a nightmare emerge. Winning 8 out of 9 Cups. And striking fear across the land. A relentless ginga, leaving opponents on the ground. Chasing a fifth straight title. Intimidating every team in their path. Speed that tears up the field. Dribbles that scramble destiny. Precision that crushes anyone bold enough to stand in the way. As if it had all been foretold... They’ll show that the future haunts even more than the past.”\n\nCOMMITMENT TO WOMEN’S FOOTBALL\n“The Legend of the Canarinha” is part of Nike’s ongoing efforts to amplify the achievements of women’s football and celebrate the impact of female athletes both on and off the pitch—reinforcing its role as the sport’s biggest supporter of women.\nIn 2025, the brand launched the global campaign “SCARY GOOD”, encouraging athletes* and fans to embrace a creative and fearless style of play. Among the campaign’s highlights is a short film starring Brazilian striker Kerolin, who faces and overcomes challengers in a fictional horror-themed game show called “Dribble to Survive.”\nIn Brazil, the “Scary Good Station” held at Parque Villa-Lobos in São Paulo offered an immersive experience inspired by athletes Kerolin, Angelina, and Gio—showcasing the talent of Brazilian players and inspiring young girls who love the game. The station was open to the public on July 18, 19, and 20.\nIf you have a body, you are an athlete.",

        "description": "'Winning isn’t Comfortable' is the second chapter of Nike’s 'Winning isn’t for Everyone' work, extended through the lens of Running. It is based on true insights and the realities Runner’s experience every time they lace up their shoes.\n\nIt adds the perspective of how hard it can be to just get out the door and go for a run. The idea that if you don’t hate running a little, you don’t love running enough. It celebrates the need and opportunity to push outside a person’s comfort zone to discover what they can accomplish, emphasising that true victory often requires pushing through uncomfortable moments.\n\nEach film of the series builds on the tension that every Runner faces – pushing through the morning dread, the elements outside, the pain of hitting a wall, or even walking down the stairs after a run or race – juxtaposed with the feeling of elation only Runners know as they push themselves beyond what they thought possible. \n\nThe irreverence of the films is in pairing visuals showing the mundanity of everyday struggles with music that brings to life a contradictory tension. \n\nThere are four films - 'Sunshine', 'Morning', 'Joy' and 'Stairs' directed by MEGAFORCE. The first film launching today, 'Sunshine' is set to the iconic lullaby 'You Are My Sunshine' by Christina Perri and features college basketball star JuJu Watkins.",
