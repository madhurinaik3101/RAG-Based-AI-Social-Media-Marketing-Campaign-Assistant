The Coca-Cola logo is recognized by 94% of the world’s population. The objective was to use the brand’s famous identity to telegraph the importance of recycling in the most impactful way. So, we decided to break our very strict brand guidelines and crush Coca-Cola’s iconic logo to inspire people to recycle every single can.",

        "description": "Today, Coca-Cola® builds on its legacy of personalised campaigns with the launch of ‘Share the Feels,’ the new dynamic OOH creative transforming name pairings into unexpected messages that capture the spark of connections between friends.\n\nLeveraging the groundbreaking success of ‘Share a Coke,’ and taking the personalised connection to a new level, ‘Share the Feels’ is designed to resonate with a new generation of Coca-Cola drinkers. The campaign encourages fans to celebrate the unique group dynamics that happen when people come together.\n\n‘Share the Feels’ was created by exploring hundreds of potential name combinations to find the right pairings. Each combination was specifically picked to evoke the most positive and unique messages that capture the energy and emotion of people coming together. For example, Finlay + Rebecca = FIRE; Paul + Arthur + Daisy = PARTY; and Maddie + Craig + Victoria = MAGIC.\n\nIslam ElDessouky, Global Vice President Creative Strategy &amp; Content at Coca-Cola says, “We believe ‘Real Magic’ happens when people come together, and ‘Share the Feels’ really embodies that ethos. The campaign shows the power in coming together through the unexpected name pairings that celebrate the joy in moments. We can’t wait to see friends engaging with this content in real time.”\n\n“We wanted to take the magic of personal connection that Share a Coke introduced and evolve it in a way that brings a fresh perspective,” said Edgard Gianesi, Chief Creative Officer, DAVID Miami. “Piccadilly Circus, one of the locations where the campaign will run, is a spectacle of lights and energy, providing the perfect space to create shared moments of joy and connection that Coca-Cola stands for.”\n\nThe OOH campaign will run throughout April, ensuring that millions of visitors and locals alike can experience Coca-Cola’s playful celebration of human connection.\n \n‘Share the Feels’ was developed by WPP Open X, led by DAVID Miami and supported by Essence Mediacom and Ogilvy PR.",

        "description": "\"We All Understand Coca-Cola\" highlights its iconic bottle as a symbol of connection. The campaign features real stories of people who overcame language barriers to share a moment over a Coke. \n \nEach story is written in two languages—one flowing from left to right, the other from right to left—meeting in the middle to form the silhouette of Coca-Cola’s signature contour bottle. This powerful visual underscores the idea that no matter how different we may seem, common connection is possible and sharing a Coca-Cola is a universal language that we all understand. The campaign includes OOH, print and digital executions and extends online at CocaColaStories.com.",
